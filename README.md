## **_Plestiodon fasciatus_ Long Read Genome Assembly**

Howdy.

This is a repository for the assembly of a _Plestiodon fasciatus_ genome from PacBio3 Revio Sequencing. This repository is modelled after Amanda Markee's [actias-luna-genome repository](https://github.com/amandamarkee/actias-luna-genome.git)

# **Sequencing Issues**

I had hoped that this new and expensive sequencing method would provide the data for a high quality reference genome. 
Unfortunately, the sequencing of this specimen came back very poorly--likely due to the preservation in Nucleic Acid Preservation buffer.
